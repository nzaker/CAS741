# References Folder

This folder contains the papers and presentations cited throughout the course in
a BiBTeX file: `References.bib`.

For the most part the file names and the citation labels are the same.
They are mostly consistent with the AuthorYear style of citations
(https://www.e-education.psu.edu/styleforstudents/c5_p11.html)

So that this repo can be public, the pdfs of the papers are available in a
private repo:
