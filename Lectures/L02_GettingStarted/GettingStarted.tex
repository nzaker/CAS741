\frametitle{Project Selection: Desired Qualities}
\begin{itemize}
\item Related to scientific computing
\item Simple, but not trivial
\item If feasible, select a project related to your research
\item Ideally, re-implement existing software
\item Each student project needs to be unique
\item Possibly a specific physical problem
\item Possibly a (family of) general purpose tool(s)
\item Some examples follow, the links are just places to get started
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Git, GitLab and GitHub}
\begin{itemize}
\item Git manages changes to documents
\bi
\item Tracks changes
\item Keeps history, you can roll back
\item Useful documentation over time
\item Allows people to work simultaneously
\ei
\item Benefits for SC \cite{WilsonEtAl2016}
\bi
\item Not necessary to make a backup copy of everything, stores just enough
  information to recreate
\item Do not need to come up with names for backup copies - same file name, but
  with timestamps
\item Enforces changelog discipline
\item Facilitates identifying conflict and merging changes
\ei
\item The real bottleneck in scientific computing~\cite{Wilson2006}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Git Typical Usage}

First either init repo or clone (git init, git clone), then typical workflow is
\be
\item update repo (git pull)
\item create files
\item stage changes to be committed (git status, git add)
\item commit staged changes (git commit -m ``message'')
\item push to remote, if using one (git push)
\ee
\bi
\item Commit after every separate issue, and when need to stop working
\item Always include a meaningful and descriptive commit message for the log
\item If a push reveals conflicts, take appropriate action to merge
