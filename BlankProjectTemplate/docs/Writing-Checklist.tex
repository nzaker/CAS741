% Show an item is done by   \item[\done] Frame the problem
% Show an item will not be fixed by   \item[\wontfix] profit

\begin{itemize}
  
\item Avoid Low Information Content phrases
  \begin{todolist}
  \item ``in order to'' simplified to ``to''
  \item ...
  \end{todolist}

\item \LaTeX points
  \begin{todolist}
  \item Only tex file (and possibly pdf files, or image files) are under version
    control.
    \item Opening and closing ``quotes'' are used (\verb|``quotes''|)
  \item Periods that do not end sentences are followed by only one space:
    \verb|``I like Dr.\ Smith.''|, or for no linebreaks: \verb|``I like Dr.~Smith.''|
  \item Long names in math mode use either mathit or text, or equivalent: $coeff$
    (\verb|$coeff$|) versus $\mathit{coeff}$ (\verb|$\mathit{coeff}$|) versus
    $\text{coeff}$ (\verb|$\text{coeff}$|).
  \item For CAS 741 the instructor would like to be able to add comments to your
    tex files.  Please be sure to include the Comments.tex file in your repo and
    in your tex files.
    \item Text should be 80 characters wide.
  \end{todolist}

\item Structure
  \begin{todolist}
  \item There is always some text between section headings
  \item There aren't instances of only one subsection within a section
  \end{todolist}

\item Spelling, Grammar and attention to detail
  \begin{todolist}
  \item Each punctuation symbol (period, comma, semicolon, question mark,
    exclamation point) has no space before it.
  \item Opening parentheses (brackets) have a space before, closing parentheses
    have a space after the symbol.
  \item Parentheses (brackets) occur in pairs, one opening and one closing
  \item All sentences begin with a capital letter.
  \item Document is spell checked!
  \item Grammar has been checked.
  \item Symbols used outside of a formula should be formatted the same way as
    they are in the equation.  For instance, when listing the variables in an
    equation, you should still use math mode for the symbols.
  \item Include a .gitignore file in your repo so that generated files are
    ignored by git
  \end{todolist}

\item Writing style
  \begin{todolist}
  \item Avoid sentences that start with ``It.''
  \end{todolist}
  
\end{itemize}
