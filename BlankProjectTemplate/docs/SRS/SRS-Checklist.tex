\begin{itemize}
  
\item Follows the template, all parts present
  \begin{todolist}
  \item Table of contents
  \item Pages are numbered
  \item Revision history included for major revisions
  \item Sections from template are all present
    \item Values of auxiliary constants are given
  \end{todolist}

\item Grammar, spelling, presentation
  \begin{todolist}
  \item No spelling mistakes (use a spell checker!)
  \item No grammar mistakes (review, ask someone else to review (at least a few
    sections))
  \item Paragraphs are structured well (clear topic sentence, cohesive)
  \item Paragraphs are concise (not wordy)
  \item No low information content phrases (url plus examples)
  \item All hyperlinks work
  \item Every figure has a caption
  \item Every table has a heading
  \item Symbolic names are used for quantities, rather than literal values

\item LaTeX
  \begin{todolist}
  \item Template comments (plt) do not show in the pdf version, either by
    removing them, or by turning them off.
  \item References and labels are used so that maintenance is feasible
\end{todolist}

\item Overall qualities of documentation
  \begin{todolist}
  \item No statement is repeated at the same level of abstraction (for instance
    the scope should be more abstract than the assumptions, the goal statements
    should be more abstract than the requirements, etc.)
    \item Someone that meets the characteristics of the intended reader could
    learn what they need to know
  \item Someone that meets the characteristics of the intended reader could
    verify all of the statement made in the SRS.  That is, they do not have to
    trust the SRS authors on any information.
\end{todolist}

\item Reference Material
  \begin{todolist}
  \item All units introduced are listed (searching the document can help look
    for other units that may be present, but not listed)
    \item Units listed are each used at least once (manually searching the
      document is a quick way to check this)
    \item The names of units named after people are in lower-case
    \item All symbols used in the document are listed in the table of symbols
    \item All symbols listed in the table of symbols are used in the document
    \item All abbreviations/acronyms used in the document are listed in the
